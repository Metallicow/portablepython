Because Portable Python is a "portable" application, it is not registered in Windows registry and your operating system does not know where python executable is located. Because of this, you can not simply type `my_script.py` on the command prompt and expect Windows to know what to do with that command. In the same way, you can not use `django-admin.py` without specifying Python executable that should be used to interpret this Python script file. Correct way to execute Python scripts in Portable Python is to use `Python-Portable.exe` like explained in [Hello World]({{site.url}}/doc/2.7/hello-world/) 

### Check your installation
In case that we want to see version of django that is installed in Portable Python, we can use command prompt and execute `Python-Portable.exe` in direct command execution mode:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}

Python-Portable.exe -c "import django; print(django.get_version());raw_input('Press <ENTER> to continue')"

{% endhighlight %}

Python built-in function `raw_input` is used in this case to get input from the user and to pause execution at the end of the script until user presses enter key. Without this function, command prompt would quickly flash and disappear and we would not have a chance to see output of the `print(django.get_version())` command.

### Create a new project
Creating a new Django project is exactly the same like explained in Django tutorials: `django-admin.py startproject mysite`, only like explained above we need to pass correct paths for Python executable and `django-admin.py`. Lets assume that our project will live in `C:\Temp`, by using command line we navigate to folder where we will create our project (in this case C:\Temp) and then create a new project called "mysite":


{% highlight text linenos=table %}

c:\Temp>"[PP root folder]\Python-Portable.exe" "[PP root folder]\App\Scripts\django-admin.py" startproject mysite

{% endhighlight %}

Where `[PP root folder]` is the full path to our Portable Python installation, e.g. `H:\Portable Python 2.7.6.1`.

This will create a folder called "mysite" in `C:\Temp` that holds skeleton of our first Django project. To start development server and see this skeleton application working, we need to navigate to folder "mysite" and start development server:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}

c:\Temp>cd mysite

c:\Temp\mysite>"[PP root folder]\Python-Portable.exe" manage.py runserver

{% endhighlight %}

This will validate models in our application and start development server - after couple of seconds, console window will open with text similar to this

{% highlight text linenos=table %}

Validating models...
